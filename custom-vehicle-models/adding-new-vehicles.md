## Installing New Vehicles

Once you have downloaded your new vehicles, itâ€™s time to combine them into a singular resource pack.

1. Using a program like 7-Zip, unarchive the Example Resource Pack into a folder.
2. Unarchive the new vehicle archive into a separate folder.
3. Move the `assets` folder from the new vehicle archive to the Example Resource Pack folder. It should combine with the `assets` folder that is already present in the Example Resource Pack folder.
4. Use 7-zip to re-archive the resource pack.
5. Follow along with Step 2 of the [Installing the Resource Pack guide](../getting-started.md#installing-the-resource-pack).
