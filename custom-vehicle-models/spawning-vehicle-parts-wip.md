# Spawning vehicle parts \(WIP\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please visit our [legacy wiki](https://github.com/VolmitSoftware/VehiclesPlus/wiki) to begin creating new vehicles
{% endhint %}

To spawn custom vehicle parts you first need to get the item

The spoiler items in my example pack are leather leggins, below are some spawn commands

```text
/minecraft:give legofreak107 minecraft:leather_leggings 1 1 {Unbreakable:1}  
/minecraft:give legofreak107 minecraft:leather_leggings 1 2 {Unbreakable:1}  
/minecraft:give legofreak107 minecraft:leather_leggings 1 3 {Unbreakable:1}  
/minecraft:give legofreak107 minecraft:leather_leggings 1 4 {Unbreakable:1}  
/minecraft:give legofreak107 minecraft:leather_leggings 1 5 {Unbreakable:1}
```

When you have these spoilers. You can use this command to make it into an addon

/addon givepart

Now you have the item. Just click the vehicle with the item
