# Dump

## Dump

The dump command allows you to dump information about react and the server into a file. This is typically useful for support and debugging

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that a full dump takes about **3 and a half minutes** to complete. If you only want coredumps, see the FORCE tag below.
{% endhint %}

### Example Dump

```css
{
    "timings": "https://www.spigotmc.org/go/timings?url=kuxusojuqa",
    "dump": "http://paste.volmit.com/onitareles.json",
    "config": "http://paste.volmit.com/xawixiwihi.yml",
    "goals": "http://paste.volmit.com/obelaruyak.json"
}
```

### Usage

```text
/re act dump
```

### Selector Usage

There are no selectors for this action

### Using the Force

You may use force with this action. Using force with this action skips the timings report, and instantly returns a link with the react coredump. Use it as

```text
/re act dump -f
```
