## Custom Color Codes

| Color Code Name | Color Code Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Glow | &g |
| Shine | &s |
| RGB | &q |
| Clickable Link \(holograms only\) | &h**&lt;url&gt;**&i**&lt;text&gt;**&r |

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use a url `&hhttps://google.com&iGoogle&r` it will send the url to the player who clicked the hologram. They can then click the url to open it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use a command \(starting with a `/`\) such as `&h/shop&iOpen Shop&r` it will make the player run the command.
{% endhint %}
