# Integrations

## PlaceholderAPI

Gloss offers placeholder support in holograms, boards, tablist, and really anywhere gloss supports its own filters.

## MVDWPlaceholderAPI

Gloss also offers MVDWPlaceholders in holograms boards, tablist and anywhere else gloss filters are supported.

## Holographic Displays

Gloss offers a converter for your existing Holographic Displays holograms. To convert your existing holographic displays to gloss holograms, use

`/gloss convert hd`

## CMI

Gloss offers a converter for your existing CMI holograms. To convert them use

`/gloss convert cmi`

## LightAPI

Gloss will use LightAPI if it is installed to emit light on holograms to make them much more visible at night. You can disable this functionality in the configuration even if you still need lightapi.

## DeluxeChat

Gloss uses the chat for formatting emojis and getting information from chat bubbles. Gloss fully supports DeluxeChat.

## FeatherBoard

Gloss does not offer any conversion with featherboard since both plugins approach boards differently. If featherboard is installed, gloss disables its own boards.

## Vault

Gloss uses vault for gloss groups and group checking. If vault is not installed, Gloss groups will not work.
