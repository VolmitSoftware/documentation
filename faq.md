# FAQ

## My vehicles won't spawn in/won't move/are invisible!

If you are using Paper, make sure that `armor-stands-tick` is set to `true` in your `paper.yml` file.

## My vehicles look like leather boots!

Make sure you've [set up your resource pack correctly](getting-started.md#installing-the-resource-pack).

## When I try to use /v shop it says there aren't any vehicles for sale!

Make sure that at least one of your vehicles has a price value set that is more than 0. For example:

`price: 1000`
