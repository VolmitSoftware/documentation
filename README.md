## What's React?

React is a performance plugin, designed to monitor the situations of your server and determine if there is a problem. If there is a problem, react will _react_ to it by stopping the instability from the source.

React also offers many features for analyzing the situation for yourself, which is very important for discovering and comparing your data versus another server you have, or comparing setups. This can also be useful for developing plugins if you are into that.
