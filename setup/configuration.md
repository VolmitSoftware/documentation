# Configuration

## config.yml

This is the default configuration file.

```yaml
config-version: 1.0.3
locale: en
canDriveOverSlabs: true
canDriveOverBlocks: true
repairCostDivision: 100.0
vehicleDamage: true
entityCollisionStop: true
entityCollisionDamageSelf: true
entityCollisionDamageEntity: true
renameCost: 1000.0
ownerChangeCost: 1000.0
onlySpawnOnSpawnpoints: false
showActionBar: true
```

### config-version

This value is used internally to determine whether or not to automatically update the `config.yml` file.

```yaml
config-version: 1.0.3
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Do not manually edit this value!** It may result in corruption of your files.
{% endhint %}

### locale

Changing this value allows you to change the language used for VehiclesPlus. The value must match a valid file under the `locale` folder.

```yaml
locale: en
```

### canDriveOverSlabs

Changes the ability to drive over half blocks, or slabs. Disabling this will prevent vehicles from automatically "climbing" over half slabs.

```yaml
canDriveOverSlabs: true
```

### canDriveOverBlocks

Changes the ability to drive over full blocks. Disabling this will prevent vehicles from automatically "climbing" over full blocks.

```yaml
canDriveOverBlocks: true
```

### repairCostDivision

The number to divide the vehicle's purchase cost by when repairing a vehicle. For example, when repairing a car that costs $15,000, by default, it will cost $150 to repair. `15000 / 100 = 150`

```yaml
repairCostDivision: 100.0
```

### vehicleDamage

Globally enable or disable vehicle damage. When disabled, vehicles will be invincible and take no damage on collision with other objects or entities.

```yaml
vehicleDamage: true
```

### entityCollisionStop

Will the vehicle come to a halt when it collides with an entity? Set to false to allow the vehicle to lose no speed when colliding with entities.

```yaml
entityCollisionStop: true
```

### entityCollisionDamageSelf

When colliding with an entity, should the vehicle take damage? Set to false to disable vehicle damage when colliding with entities.

```yaml
entityCollisionDamageSelf: true
```

### entityCollisionDamageEntity

When colliding with an entity, should the entity take damage? Set to false to disable entity damage when the entity is hit by a vehicle.

```yaml
entityCollisionDamageEntity: true
```

### renameCost

The price that it costs to rename your vehicle.

```yaml
renameCost: 1000.0
```

### ownerChangeCost

The price that it costs to transfer your vehicle to a new owner.

```yaml
ownerChangeCost: 1000.0
```

### onlySpawnOnSpawnpoints

Should vehicles only be able to spawn on a Spawnpoint? Set to false to allow vehicles to be spawned in anywhere.

```yaml
onlySpawnOnSpawnpoints: false
```

### showActionBar

Should an action bar with vehicle stats be shown while in the driver's seat? Set to false to disable.

```yaml
showActionBar: true
```

## sounds.yml

This is the default `sounds.yml` configuration file.

```yaml
sounds:
  examplecar-engine-idle:
    sound: car.idle
    duration: 6
  examplecar-engine-start:
    sound: car.start
    duration: 2
  examplecar-engine-accelerate:
    sound: car.accelerate
    duration: 2
  examplecar-engine-driving:
    sound: car.driving
    duration: 2
  examplecar-engine-slowingdown:
    sound: car.slowingdown
    duration: 2
```

### Understanding sounds.yml

Each vehicle can have its own sound effects associated with it. Currently, the example resource pack only provides sounds for the example car.

There are **six** different types of sounds that can be made during a vehicle's motion:

* idle
* start
* accelerate
* driving
* slowingdown

Each sound corresponds to a specific type of motion that the vehicle can make.

#### idle

Sound produced when a vehicle is not in motion.

#### start

Sound produced when a vehicle starts up.

#### accelerate

Sound produced when a vehicle is speeding up.

#### driving

Sound produced when a vehicle is driving at a near-constant speed.

#### slowingdown

Sound produced when a car is slowing down.

The `sound` value corresponds to a specific sound file found in the resource pack. Additionally, the `duration` value corresponds to the sound's duration.

### Adding Custom Vehicle Sounds

Editing or adding vehicle sounds is quite simple.

1. Begin by duplicating the `examplecar` sound configuration in the `sounds.yml` file.
2. Edit the `examplecar` values to match the name of your vehicle. For example, if I had a vehicle named TestVehicle, I would change `examplecar-engine-idle` to `testvehicle-engine-idle`.
3. Add your sound files to your resource pack, under the `assets/minecraft/sounds` folder. It is highly recommended that you create an additional folder for your specific vehicle's sounds, such as `assets/minecraft/sounds/testvehicle`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `sounds.yml` file is case insensitive. You may choose to change your car's name to be completely lowercase if you wish, as shown in the example above.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to make sure that your sound files are in the `.ogg` format. Minecraft does not support any other sound format. An online MP3 to OGG converter can be found [here](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg).
